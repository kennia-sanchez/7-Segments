Write a program in Sherlock that analyzes the display images of a 7-segment display included in this zip file (Include an already started program, as it requires converting the images from color to grayscale). <br>

There are three possible outcomes: <br>
➔ 1. The screen is off; in which case, write "Off" on the screen.<br>
➔ 2. The screen displays a correct value; in which case, provide the value shown on the screen. <br>
➔ 3. The segments of the screen are lit up and display an incorrect number; in this case, write "Burnt segments" on the screen. <br>

<i>Convert each image from RGB to grayscale within Sherlock. Use alignment tools to track the 7-segment display.</i>
